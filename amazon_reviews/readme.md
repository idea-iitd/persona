## Dataset
The dataset is constructed based on publicly available data [1]:

- 1,470 users who have reviewed at least 5 products were randomly sampled from the Amazon_Fashion category of the Amazon Reviews dataset, available at [https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) [1].
- These users collectively reviewed 12,404 products, resulting in a total of 15,127 user-product edges.
- Each edge represents a userâ€™s interaction (i.e., review) with a product, forming a bipartite graph between users and products.
- Product features are provided in the dataset, which are further converted to one-hot product features, while user features were randomly initialized.
- A directed edge is created from a product to a persona if the product has been purchased at least twice by users belonging to that persona.
- A total of 6 personas exist for users in the dataset.

The dataset consists of 
- pe.npy -  products embeddings
- lab.npy - persona labels for all users
- ei_u2pro.npy - the edges from user to product, Note that the edges between user to product are undirected. (Refer Figure 2 in main paper)
- ei_pro2per.npy - the edges from product to persona, Note that these edges are directed from product to persona. (Refer Figure 2 in main paper)
- The dataset has a total of 1000 train users, 150 validation users and 306 test users.
